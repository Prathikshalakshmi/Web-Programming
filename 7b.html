<p>Mangalore is the heart of a distinct multilinguisticâ€”cultural region : Tulunadu a homeland of Tulu-speaking People, which was nearly coterminous with the modern district of South Canara. In the third century BC, the town formed part of the Maurya Empire, ruled by the Mauryan emperor, Ashoka of Magadha.Since it is a coastal area, seafood is popular in Mangaluru. Students from different states of India come here for their education, especially keralites. And to someone moving to Mangalore/Mangaluru, it would be a very good decision.</p>
<p>The Pilivesha (Tiger dance) is a folk dance unique to this area, which is performed during Dasara and Krishna Janmashtami. Karadi Vesha (Bear Dance) is performed during Dasara in Mangalore. Bhuta Kola or spirit worship, is practised here. Kambala or buffalo race is conducted in water filled paddy fields. Mangalore is named after the goddess Mangaladevi. Other names used by the locals are 'Kudla' (Tulu), 'Mangalooru' (Kannada), 'Mangalapuram' (Malayalam),'Kodeyaala' ("Havyaka"), 'Kodial' (Konkani), 'Maikala' (Beary) and 'Manjarun'(sanskrith). </p>
