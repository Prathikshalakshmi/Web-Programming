<h1>Taare Zameen Par</h1>
<p>The film Taare Zameen Par (Stars upon the Ground) portrays the tormented life at school and at home of a child with dyslexia and his eventual success after his artistic talents are discovered by his art teacher at the boarding school.The title of the film directly translates from Hindi to 'Stars upon the ground. ' The director Aamir Khan uses this metaphor to enlighten audiences of the idea that children are like stars in the world, and that every child is special in his or her own way.</p>

<p>Ishaan Awasthi is an eight year-old boy who is suffering from dyslexia, a neurological disorder. He is having a trouble recognizing letters, can hardly read and write. Letters and numbers are written invertedly and words are commonly misspelled. He can not follow multiple instructions and has poor motor skills. Being different from other normal growing children, he is always thought to be dumb, idiot and lazy. His teachers, classmates, neighbors and even his own family did not realize what he is going through.Mr. Nikumbh teaches Ishaan sequentially from a simple lesson to a complex lesson and moves from one step to the next as Ishaan masters each level of language skills. For example, he taught Ishaan by starting with vowels and moving on to consonants, then on to words, and then sentences.<p>

<p>The film beautifully showed how a teacher can double up as the parent and look after a student like their own child. Not giving up and honing a child's unique talent without underestimating them, it touched upon the issue of dealing with dyslexic kids in the most sensitive way.</p>
